# sass-boilerplate


how to use it:

### 1. First install:
```
npm install
```

### 2. Watch scss and pug files

```
npm run watch
```

### 3. Compile javascript / react

run this in a different terminal window!

```
npm start
```

this should open a browser window and have live-reload of the javascript. 

`index.html` will be created automatically, if you want a different custom page, create a pug file in the templates folder, and it will then be available at `/template-name.html`
